    "# Project 1 - Iowa Liquor \n",
    "\n",
    "You are a data scientist in residence at the Iowa State tax board. The Iowa State legislature is considering changes in the liquor tax rates and wants a report of current liquor sales by county and projections for the rest of the year. \n",
    "\n",
    "Your task is as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Calculate the yearly liquor sales for each store using the provided data. You can add up the transactions for each year, and store sales in 2015 specifically will be used later as your target variable.\n",
    "* Use the data from 2015 to make a linear model using as many variables as you find useful to predict the yearly sales of all stores. You must use the sales from Jan to March as one of your variables.\n",
    "* Use your model for 2015 to estimate total sales in 2016, extrapolating from the sales so far for Jan-March of 2016.\n",
    "* Report your findings, including any projected increase or decrease in total sales (over the entire state) for the tax committee of the Iowa legislature.\n",
    "* Use cross-validation to check how your model predicts to held out data compared to the model metrics on the full dataset.\n",
    "* Fit your model(s) using one or both of the regularization tactics covered. Explain whether the regularized or the non-regularized model performed better and what the selected regression(s) are doing.\n",

I would also point out that we are not looking at a very normal distribution for Sales Dollars."
